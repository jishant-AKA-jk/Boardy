This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Here's the problem statement:

<p>Objective:<br>
Create a Trello-like board (Trello) that allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and rearranging task cards within multiple lists. This assignment focuses on implementing drag-and-drop functionality, dynamic state updates, and an interactive UI. Use React/Next for this assignment.<br>
UI Requirements:<br>
Main Layout:<br>
Header:<br>
A title/logo.<br>
A button to reset the board (clears all lists and cards).<br>
Board Area:<br>
A horizontally scrollable layout of multiple lists (columns).<br>
Each list contains a title and a collection of draggable task cards.<br>
Footer (optional):<br>
Basic app info or developer credit.<br>
UI Components:<br>
Board:<br>
A container for multiple lists.<br>
Lists should be arranged horizontally and allow horizontal scrolling if there are many lists.<br>
List:<br>
Each list has:<br>
A title.<br>
A button to add a new card.<br>
A button to delete the list.<br>
A collection of draggable cards.<br>
Lists should be draggable for reordering within the board.<br>
Card:<br>
Each card displays a title<br>
Cards should be draggable within and across lists.<br>
Clicking on a card opens a modal with detailed information and options to edit the title, description, setting due date and delete the card.<br>
Add New List:<br>
A button or placeholder to add a new list.<br>
Ask the user to enter a title for the list.<br>
Functionality Requirements:<br>
Add and Manage Lists:<br>
Users can:<br>
Add a new list by entering a title.<br>
Delete a list along with its associated cards.<br>
Rename a list title.<br>
Add and Manage Cards:<br>
Users can:<br>
Add a new card to a specific list by entering a title.<br>
Edit the card title, description and due date (description and due date can only be added after opening the modal by clicking on the card).<br>
Delete a card.<br>
Drag-and-Drop:<br>
Implement drag-and-drop functionality:<br>
Cards can be moved within a list or across lists.<br>
Lists can be reordered within the board.<br>
Persistence:<br>
Store all the data of the board in localStorage so that the data persists across page reloads.<br>
Reset Board:<br>
A button in the header clears all lists and cards, resetting the board to its initial state.<br>
Design Guidelines:<br>
Layout:<br>
Mimic Trello's clean, card-based UI with rounded corners and subtle shadows.<br>
Use a visually appealing color scheme.<br>
Responsiveness:<br>
Allow horizontal scrolling for lists on smaller screens.</p>

<p>Note: It&rsquo;s better to explore the Trello platform before starting the project to understand the functionality and to take reference for the UI.<br>
